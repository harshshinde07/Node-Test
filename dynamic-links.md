Firebase Dynamic Links Quickstart
==============================


  - Replace the **applicationId** in `app/build.gradle` with the package name that matches your app code.
- Run the sample on your Android device or emulator.
- Using the sample:
  - When the application is started, a deep link will be generated using your app code.
  - Click **Share**
    to share this deep link to another application.
  - The application checks if it was launched from a deep link. If so, the link data will be displayed under the **Receive** heading.
  - Try sharing the deep link from the application and use that deep link to re-launch the application.
